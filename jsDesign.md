# DESIGN FOR THE JAVASCRIPT

## WHAT THE PROGRAM IS

This program is a calculator application with a web interface. It contains a form with a text input and buttons. The user can enter an equation into a text input. The calculator will parse and evaluate that equation. It will then clear the text input and return the result inside the text input. Users can enter the text input in two ways:

- directly from the keyboard. They will submit when they enter the equal sign key.
- by pressing buttons on the form which will add the corresponding key to the text form.
